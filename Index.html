        <h3 id=Introduction>Where to start...</h3>
        <p>Well incase you couldn’t have guessed my name is Nina (Hello World), I’m 23 years old and I currently live in
            Manchester.. However I’m not originally from Manchester, I’m actually from York. So how did I end up in
            Manchester doing a Software Developer Course?
            Well…. After leaving college I went to Northumbria University, and studied Business with Tourism Management.
            Whilst I was at Northumbria University I was lucky enough to spend my four years in three different
            locations:
        <ul>
            <li>Newcastle, UK</li>
            <li>Lisbon, Portugal</li>
            <li>America</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Connecticut</li>
                <li>Florida</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        I was lucky enough to study in Newcastle and Portugal and did my placement year working in events at two
        American Country Clubs.</p>
        <h4>So how did I get into tech?</h4>
        <p>Well… After leaving university I was at a cross roads, and like a large amount of graduates I had a lot of
            ambition but not enough experience. Luckily I was employed by the NHS to work as an Application
            Administrator and within a year of doing this job I was promoted to Application Analyst. Whilst working as
            an Application Administrator I was introduced into the wonderful world of technology and the vast amount of
            opportunities this industry offered… So I decided to do some research and really think what it was that I
            enjoyed about my job and what skills/attributes I have:
        <ul>
            <li>Curious</li>
            <li>Solving Problems</li>
            <li>Communicating</li>
            <li>Organising</li>
            <li>I Enjoy Learning</li>
            <li>Creative</li>
        </ul>
        After putting <b>2+2</b> together I got = Software Development / Web Development.
        After 6 months of research and consideration I committed (pardon the git hub pun) to Manchester Codes!!! And
        here we are!

            personal level).</p>
