        <h4>Interests and Hobbies:</h4>

        <h4>Walking/Running:</h4>
        <p>I’m quite an avid rambler, throughout lockdown I also started to run (just like the majority of the
            population of the UK) my aim for 2021(2) is to run a half marathon. I am also quite an active rambler my
            favourite walk we’ve done recently was the midnight walk up Snowdon - which I would recommend to anyone
            (just look at that view).</p>
        <h4>Cooking:</h4>
        <p>I love to cook and I love to go out to try a wide variety fo cosines and dinning experiences. My favourite
            dish
            to cook at home is a Panang Curry. I would say my favourite website for inspiration is MOB Kitchen - if
            you’ve
            not yet taken a look I would advise it.</p>
        <h4>Travelling:</h4>
        <q>“My Favourite thing to do is go where I’ve never been”</q>
        <p>I love to travel and all the experiences that come with it, whilst I was in university I went travelling to
            Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand for three months, I was also lucky enough to experience living in Lisbon and
            America. Whilst I was working in America we took part in an East Coast Road Trip travelling from Florida all
            the
            way to New York. The most recent destination I experience was Iceland, which was AMAZING - and I would say
            is my
            favourite destination in Europe I have been to. My next travel plans are to Canada to visit Lake Louise and
            the
            Rocky Mountains.</p>
        <h4>Live Music / Avid Podcast Listener:</h4>
        <p>I’ve got quite an eclectic music taste ranging from Country - R&B - Indie. Whilst at university I worked at
            O2
            Academy in Newcastle and this was a great opportunity to see a variety of artists on top of my favourite
            bands.
            I also love to listen to podcasts and my current favourite is “Redhanded” a murder podcast.</p>
        <p><b>Well that’s enough about me!</b></p>
